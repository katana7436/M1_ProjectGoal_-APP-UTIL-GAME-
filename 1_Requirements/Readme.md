# High level requirements:
                These are the features of my project:   
                    1.) Initializes the game using a button
                    2.) 2 players play alternatively 
                    3.) refreshes the display after each turn
                    4.) Displays the winner at the end

# Low Level Requirements of this Project
                All the high level requirements are implemented using functions.
                    1.) void startGame();
                    2.) display();
                    3.) p1();
                    4.) p2();
                    5.) check();
                    6.) intro();
